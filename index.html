          As part of the experimental features in Minecraft Bedrock version
          1.18.10, Mojang has revealed some of the abilities of the frog mobs
          coming in this year's Wild Update. They can eat small Slimes and small
          Magma Cubes, which is a goofy enough habit. As Mojang shared during
          today's Minecraft Live presentation, frogs had a brief period as apex
          predators capable of swallowing entire goats. Players started noticing
          this savage frog behavior in the beta version of Minecraft for Windows
          back in January. Their hunger was, as some players realized,
          insatiable.
